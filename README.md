## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the spellcheck.sh script available in the ci directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words, which is provided in ci/dictionary.txt. If the script produces a false positive (say, you used word BTreeMap which the script considers invalid), you need to add this word to ci/dictionary.txt (keep the sorted order for consistency).
